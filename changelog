1.3.4

* Improvements in acquiring one specific mutex for getting results from the device.
* In the updater thread, removes all newline chars when retrieving data from github.

1.3.3

* Change in the routine that retrieves last usage statistics from the device, to adjust values that are the same as the previous ones.
  This is because Home Assistant does not report a new value when it is equal to the previous one. So, to overcome this behavior, repeated
  values are subtracted a little bit: by 1 for "last duration", by 1.0 for "last water usage" and by 10.0 for "last gas usage". The amount
  changed is almost negligible, assuming the likelihood of having the exact same values in subsequent utilizations.

1.3.2

* Corrected mapping for values reported by the device, which are used to define the mode (heat, off).
* The updater process now reports even when there are no updates available (just to prove that it is alive).

1.3.1

* Small code refactoring in the function that processes messages sent to HA.
* Corrected small bug introduced in 1.3.0, regarding the MQTT polling process.

1.3.0

* Code refactoring for better handling background tasks.
* Code refactoring in the update check function.
* Small change in how errors collected from device are returned to HA.
* Change the way MQTT discovery messages are sent to HA, to avoid "unavailable" state after HA restarts.
* Change the way MQTT polling is made, to provide better response time in message processing and also in case of program termination.

1.2.1

* Added option to disable check for updates (See documentation on docker hub for details).
* Better treatment of errors triggered by the update verification thread.

1.2.0

* Added sensor for displaying errors reported by the device (same error code shown in device display).
* Added sensor for showing application version updates. The download and installation process must be made manually, though.

1.1.3

* Added HEALTH_CHECK to the container.
* Sensors that never have zero values (last gas and water use, for example) now report the last valid value instead of zero
  when the API returns error.
